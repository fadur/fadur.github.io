        <title>The beginning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The this blog starts here. Supposedly the first entry. I&amp;#39;ve previously attempted to regularly blog. I usually fall off at post number three. This time however its going to different. Coming off a three week vacation, I decided to revive this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am terrified of becoming the coder in a managerial position who only writes product specs and attends meetings. Needless to say that is what I&amp;#39;ve become as of late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am not big on insights and reflections, basically I need an excuse to start experimenting again. I promised myself to use my downtime in keeping this space fresh with my learnings. Hopefully I&amp;#39;ll keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
