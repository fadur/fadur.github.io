The following presentation is a tech-session with my team, showcasing React.
For a while I've been itching to try out [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I finally found a feature with enough weight to justify trying it out.

The product is a table containing attributes that can be changed. The challenge
was only allowing users to change one field at a time. This would give us an
ability to create an audit trail. 

I wanted to log each individual transaction made, all while giving the user
options where they can justify their actions.
