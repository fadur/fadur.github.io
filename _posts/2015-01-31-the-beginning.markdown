The this blog starts here. Supposedly the first entry. I've previously attempted to regularly blog. I usually fall off at post number three. This time however its going to different. Coming off a three week vacation, I decided to revive this space.

I am terrified of becoming the coder in a managerial position who only writes product specs and attends meetings. Needless to say that is what I've become as of late.

Am not big on insights and reflections, basically I need an excuse to start experimenting again. I promised myself to use my downtime in keeping this space fresh with my learnings. Hopefully I'll keep it up.
